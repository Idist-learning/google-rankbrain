# GOOGLE RANKBRAIN:
## The Definitive Guide


![][1]

If you’re serious about SEO, you NEED to optimize for RankBrain.

Why?

Well, Google recently announced that RankBrain is Google’s third most important ranking signal.

And it’s becoming more important every day.

In today’s guide you’re going to learn everything you need to know about Google’s RankBrain algorithm. Let’s do this.


# CHAPTER 1:
## Google RankBrain: A Visual Explanation

![][2]

What is Google RankBrain?

RankBrain is a machine learning (AI) algorithm that Google uses to sort the search results. It also helps Google process and understand search queries.

So: what makes RankBrain different?

Before RankBrain, 100% of Google’s algorithm was hand-coded. So the process went something like this:

![][3]

Human engineers still work on the algorithm, of course. But today, RankBrain also does its thing in the background.

![][4]

In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.

Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority etc.

Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with the new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.

Here’s the craziest part:

Google asked a group of Google Engineers to identify the best page for a given search. They also asked RankBrain.

And RankBrain outperformed brainy Google engineers by 10%!

In short, RankBrain works. And it’s here to stay.

Now that you’ve seen an overview of what RankBrain is, let’s dive deeper into how it works.

# CHAPTER 2:
## How RankBrain Works

![][6]

RankBrain has two main jobs:

1. Understanding search queries (keywords)
2. Measuring how people interact with the results (user satisfaction)

Let’s break each of these down.

## How RankBrain Understands Any Keyword That You Search For

A few years ago, Google had a problem:

15% of the keywords that people typed into Google were never seen before.

15% may not seem like a lot. But when you process billions of searches per day, that amounted to 450 million keywords that stumped Google every day.

Before RankBrain, Google would scan pages to see if they contained the exact keyword someone searched for.

But because these keywords were brand new, Google had no clue what the searcher actually wanted. So they guessed.

For example, let’s say you searched for “the grey console developed by Sony”. Google would look for pages that contained the terms “grey”, “console”, “developed” and “Sony”.

![][7]

Today, RankBrain actually understands what you’re asking. And it provides a 100% accurate set of results:

![][8]

Not bad.

What changed? Before, Google would try to match the words in your search query to words on a page.

Today, RankBrain tries to actually figure out what you mean. You know, like a human would.

How? By matching never-before-seen keywords to keywords that Google HAS seen before.

For example, Google RankBrain may have noticed that lots of people search for “grey console developed by Nintendo”.

And they’ve learned that people who search for “grey console developed by Nintendo” want to see a set of results about gaming consoles.

So when someone searches for “the grey console developed by Sony”, RankBrain brings up similar results to the keyword it already knows (“grey console developed by Nintendo”).

So it shows results about consoles. In this case, the PlayStation.

![][9]

Another example: a while back [Google published a blog post][10] about how they’re using machine learning to better understand searcher intent:

![][11]

In that post they describe a technology called “Word2vec” that turns keywords into concepts.

For example, Google says that this technology “understands that Paris and France are related the same way Berlin and Germany are (capital and country), and not the same way Madrid and Italy are”.

![][12]

Even though this post wasn’t talking specifically about RankBrain, RankBrain likely uses similar technology.

In short: Google RankBrain goes beyond simple keyword-matching. It turns your search term into concepts… and tries to find pages that cover that concept.

In chapter 3 I’ll show you how this changes the way we should do SEO keyword research. But first, let’s cover the most interesting element of what RankBrain does…

## How RankBrain Measures User Satisfaction
Sure, RankBrain can take a stab at understanding new keywords. And it can even tweak the algorithm on its own.

But the big question is:

Once RankBrain shows a set of results, how does it know if they’re actually good?

Well, it observes:

![][13]

In other words, RankBrain shows you a set of search results that they think you’ll like. If lots of people like one particular page in the results, they’ll give that page a rankings boost.

And if you hated it? They’ll drop that page and replace it with a different page. And the next time someone searches for that keyword (or a similar term), they’ll see how it performs.

What is RankBrain observing exactly?

It’s paying very close attention to how you interact with the search results. Specifically, it’s looking at:

Organic Click-Through-Rate
Dwell Time
Bounce Rate
Pogo-sticking
These are known as user experience signals (UX signals).

Let’s look at an example:

You pulled a muscle in your back playing tennis. So you search for “pulled back muscle” in Google.

![][14]

Like most people, you click on the first result. Unfortunately, the intro is full of fluff and filler content (“Your back is an important muscle group…”).

So you hit your back button and check out the 2nd result:

![][15]

This one isn’t much better. It’s full of generic advice like “rest and ice your back”.

So you hit your browser’s back button yet again and give result #3 a shot.

![][16]

Bingo! This result is EXACTLY what you’re looking for.

So instead of hitting “back”, you spend 5 minutes reading through the page’s physical therapy routine. And because you got what you wanted, you didn’t revisit the search results.

This back-and-forth is called “Pogo-sticking”. And it’s something that RankBrain pays a lot of attention to.

If Google notices that people quickly leave a page to click on a different search result, that sends a strong message to Google: “That page stinks!”.

![][17]

And if Google notices that lots of people STOP pogo-sticking on a specific result, they’re going to give that page a boost to make it easier to find.

![][18]

I’ll have lots more on optimizing for UX signals in Chapters 4 and 5. But for now, it’s time for me to show you how RankBrain changes how keyword research works.
